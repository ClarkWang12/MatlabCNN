Matlab codes for 2D Convolutional Neural Network

Inspired by "https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/DeepLearnToolbox", but focus on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). 

Features:
* Basical layer (M-to-N transform): Full connection, Convolutional, Subsampling
* Activation layer (pointwise transform): Sigmoid, Relu
* Regularization: Dropout (implemented as pointwise transform), Max norm
* Parameter updating: Naive SGD, Momentum SGD
* Loss: Least Square (for classification/regression), Softmax/Cross-entropy/Logistic-loss (for classification)

**Caution: Feel free to use the code, but it is primarily for my personal playing around and the developement is ongoing, so no guarantee for bug-free:)**
