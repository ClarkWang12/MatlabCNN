=========

Matlab codes for 2D Convolutional Neural Network

Inspired by "https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/DeepLearnToolbox", but focus on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). 

Features:
* Basical layer (M-to-N transform): Full connection, Convolutional, Subsampling
* Activation layer (pointwise transform): Sigmoid, Relu
* Regularization: Dropout (implemented as pointwise transform), Weight constraint
* Parameter updating: Naive SGD, Momentum SGD
* Loss: Least Square (for classification/regression), Softmax (a.k.a. logistic loss, for classification)

**Caution: developement ongoing, probable errors/bugs and missing features**
